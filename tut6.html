    <!-- Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not. -->

    <!-- Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph. -->

    <!--Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!  -->

    <!-- examples -->

    <p style="border: 2px solid red;">this is a paragraph</p>
    <p style="border: 2px solid blue;">this is a paragraph</p>
    <span style="border: 2px solid green;">this is a span</span> <span style="border: 2px solid yellow ;">this is a
        span</span>
